  <h1><b>Low and Slow</b></h1>
  <p>This week I am <em>extremely</em> excited about a new cooking technique called <dfn><i>sous vide</i></dfn>. In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food (usually vacuum-sealed in plastic) into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <cite>Cooking for Geeks</cite>, Jeff Potter describes it as <q>ultra-low-temperature poaching.</q></p>

  <br><p>Next month, we will be serving <b>Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise</b>. To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before November 30.</p></br>
